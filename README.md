# Braze Flutter SDK

Effective marketing automation is an essential part of successfully scaling and managing your business.

This project contains the Braze
[plug-in package](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/),
a specialized package that allows integrators to use certain Braze APIs from Flutter app code written in Dart.

### Getting Started

1) Follow the directions in the [Install Tab](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/braze_plugin#-installing-tab-) to import Braze into your project.

2) Instantiate an instance of the Braze plugin by calling `new BrazePlugin()`

#### Android

1) In your `res/values` directory, create a file called `appboy.xml` and add your API key and set your custom endpoint as specified in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/#step-2-configure-the-braze-sdk-in-appboyxml).

2) Add required permissions to your `AndroidManifest`, as specified in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/initial_sdk_setup/android_sdk_integration/#step-3-add-required-permissions-to-android-manifest).

3) To integrate push, follow the directions in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/push_notifications/integration/). Note that only registration using our "automatic FCM registration" is currently supported from Flutter apps.

#### iOS

1) Call `Appboy.startWithApiKey()` in your `AppDelegate`'s `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` delegate method as specified in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/initial_sdk_setup/#step-4-updating-your-app-delegate).

2) Set your custom endpoint as specified in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/initial_sdk_setup/initial_sdk_setup/#step-5-specify-your-custom-endpoint-or-data-cluster). We recommend the `Info.plist` approach.

#### In-app messages

##### Disabling automatic display

Native in-app messages display automatically out of the box on Android and iOS.

To disable automatic in-app message display for Android, implement the `IInAppMessageManagerListener` delegate as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/in-app_messaging/customization/#setting-a-custom-manager-listener). Your `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed` method implementation should return `InAppMessageOperation.DISCARD`. For an example, see `MainActivity.kt` in our example app.

To disable automatic in-app message display for iOS, implement the `ABKInAppMessageControllerDelegate` delegate as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/in-app_messaging/customization/#in-app-message-controller-delegate). Your `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed` delegate implementation should return `ABKInAppMessageDisplayChoice.discardInAppMessage`. For an example, see `AppDelegate.swift` in our example app.

##### In-app message data callback

You may set a callback in Dart to receive Braze in-app message data in the Flutter host app.

To set the callback, call `BrazePlugin.setBrazeInAppMessageCallback()` from your Flutter app with a function that takes a `BrazeInAppMessage` instance. The `BrazeInAppMessage` object supports a subset of fields available in the native model objects, including `uri`, `message`, `header`, `buttons`, `extras`, and more.

On Android, you will additionally need to implement the `IInAppMessageManagerListener` delegate as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/in-app_messaging/customization/#setting-a-custom-manager-listener). Your `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed()` method implementation must call `BrazePlugin.process(inAppMessage)`. For an example, see `MainActivity.kt` in our example app.

On iOS, you will additionally need to implement the `ABKInAppMessageControllerDelegate` delegate as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/in-app_messaging/customization/#in-app-message-controller-delegate). Your `beforeInAppMessageDisplayed` delegate implementation must call `BrazePlugin.process(inAppMessage)`. For an example, see `AppDelegate.swift` in our example app.

To log analytics using your `BrazeInAppMessage`, pass the instance into the `logInAppMessageClicked`, `logInAppMessageImpression`, and `logInAppMessageButtonClicked` methods available on the main plugin interface.

#### Content Cards

##### Content Card data callback

You may set a callback in Dart to receive Braze Content Card data in the Flutter host app.

To set the callback, call `BrazePlugin.setBrazeContentCardsCallback()` from your Flutter app with a function that takes a `List<BrazeContentCard>` instance. The `BrazeContentCard` object supports a subset of fields available in the native model objects, including `description`, `title`, `image`, `url`, `extras`, and more.

On Android, you will additionally need to implement and register an `IEventSubscriber<ContentCardsUpdatedEvent>` as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/content_cards/customization/#fully-custom-content-card-display-for-android). Your `trigger()` method implementation must call `BrazePlugin.processContentCards(event.allCards)`. For an example, see `MainActivity.kt` in our example app.

On iOS, you will additionally need to create an `NSNotificationCenter` listener for `ABKContentCardsProcessedNotification` events as described in our [public documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/ios/content_cards/data_model/). Your `ABKContentCardsProcessedNotification` callback implementation must call `BrazePlugin.processContentCards(contentCards)`. For an example, see `AppDelegate.swift` in our example app.

To log analytics using your `BrazeContentCard`, pass the instance into the `logContentCardClicked`, `logContentCardImpression`, and `logContentCardDismissed` methods available on the main plugin interface.
